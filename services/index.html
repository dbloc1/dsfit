              <h3>What to expect with In-Home Personal Training</h3>
              <h4>In-Depth Assessment</h4>
                <p>Each new client starts with a detailed assessment covering measurements and several aspects of movement. We then use the data as a baseline to track progress and to design the perfect program for your unique body and needs.</p>
              <h4>Weekly Progress Checks</h4>
                <p>Every week we track your progress using the most important metrics for your specific goals. This can be an extremely useful tool for both accountability and motivation. For starters, nothing is more motivating than seeing progress from week to week, and knowing that someone else is monitoring your progress adds that extra layer of accountability to top it off.</p>
              <h4>Training Comes to You</h4>
                <p>No time spent in traffic and no need to purchase any fancy equipment. We find a time that works best, and I come right to your front door with all required equipment. You just make sure you’re ready to put in the work!</p>
              <h4>Personalized Fitness Program</h4>
                <p>Based on our initial assessment, you’re built a personalized program tailored to your goals and needs using the latest evidence-based methods. Any previous injuries, pains or limitations are taken into account, and exercises are modified as needed. This is where we put the plan into action!</p>
              <h4>ProCoach Nutrition Platform</h4>
                <p>The world’s premier nutrition software. ProCoach is a platform that delivers daily nutrition lessons and biweekly eating habits that, when combined with the one to one problem solving involved while working with your coach, make the results you want inevitable.</p>
              <h4>High Accountability</h4>
                <p>Perhaps the most important aspect of working in-person with a trainer. Scheduled appointments, having money in the game (paying for training), in-depth goal setting, commitment contracts, and ongoing coaching all provide you the accountability needed to keep you going when times get tough. It’s a fact of life that on occasion you will have a bad week, your motivation will wane, and sometimes the last thing you will want to do is train when you’ve had a particularly rough day.
              That’s what accountability is all about because in training, as in life, if you want to achieve something great, you need to be consistent over time!</p>

                  <h3>What to expect with Online Personal Training</h3>
                  <h4>Initial Video Assessment</h4>
                    <p>An absolute must, and the first thing we do before designing your program. Using Skype, I will take you through an assortment of movement and mobility tasks that provide us with the information needed to design the ideal program for you.</p>
                  <h4>ProCoach Nutrition Platform</h4>
                    <p>The worlds premier nutrition software. ProCoach is a platform that delivers daily nutrition lessons and biweekly eating habits that, when combined with the ongoing communication you’ll have while working remotely with your coach, make the results you want inevitable.</p>
                  <h4>Mobile Training App</h4>
                    <p>Using the Trainerize fitness app, customized workouts are delivered to your phone allowing you to workout wherever and whenever you want. All exercises in your program have video demonstrations to help you workout both safely and effectively, and we track several measures of progress through the app to make sure you’re progressing just the way we want.</p>
                  <h4>Unlimited Support</h4>
                    <p>You have questions, I have answers (hopefully!). Either through email or the Trainerize app, I am here to support you throughout your training journey. I provide some general guidelines for communication but rest assured that your questions will be answered within 24 hours!</p>
                  <h4>Biweekly Check-In Calls</h4>
                    <p>Not mandatory but highly recommended, we use check-in calls to see what’s going well and what might not be going so well with your training. It’s also a great coaching opportunity to get into some of the deeper aspects of motivation and problem solving that can be more easily addressed in a conversation than in text, not to mention, it adds a layer of accountability that can provide that extra boost to help you toward success! </p>
                  <h4>High Flexibility</h4>
                    <p>Arguably the most valuable aspect of online training. You feel like training at 3am? No problem. Training in person is dictated by 60 minutes sessions. With online training, sessions can be as short or long as needed/desired. You can train while in another country, in a gym, at home or on a beach. As I’ve mentioned before you get to train wherever, whenever (and let’s add), and however you want!  </p>

                <div class="hybrid-approach">
                  <h3>Wait… didn't you say something about the hybrid approach?</h3>
                  <p>Put simply, the hybrid approach is a combination of in-home and online personal training. Here are 3 great reasons why someone would want to use the hybrid approach:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Some people love working with their coach in person but for one reason or another, can only train in person once per week. We all know that nothing great was built spending 1 hour per week on it, so we use the hybrid method to supplement their in-home training with online training to get more workouts in.</li>
                    <li>A client who travels (whether for work or pleasure) for most of the year. We would use the hybrid approach to train in person when they are home and then create an online program for the times when they are away.</li>
                    <li>There are some clients who mainly train online but for certain exercises they want more detail on, or specific challenges they may be having, they know it would be best to work with their coach in person. In this case it would be most effective to book a session or more to get the issue dealt with as soon as possible (some problems are solved many times faster when a professional can see the issue in person).</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Those are just a few of many possible reasons that the hybrid approach could be the best solution for you!</p>
