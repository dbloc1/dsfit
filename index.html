        <p class="benefits-item-description">Get Stronger: Progressive resistance training makes you physically stronger. Better yet, going through that process makes you feel stronger in both body and mind, giving you the knowledge through experience that you really can change. And the confidence to start doing the things you’ve always dreamed of doing.</p>

It all begins when you make that commit to start moving!</p>
